       "Some key features of Azure include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Azure provides virtual machines, storage, and networking capabilities, allowing you to create virtual infrastructure similar to on-premises environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Azure offers a wide range of services such as App Services, Functions, and Logic Apps, which allow you to develop, deploy, and manage applications without having to worry about underlying infrastructure.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Containers: Azure provides containerization support through services such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Container Instances (ACI), allowing you to easily run and manage containerized applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Storage and Databases: Azure provides various storage options including Blob storage, File storage, and Table storage. It also offers managed database services like Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. AI and Machine Learning: Azure has a suite of services that enable the development and deployment of AI and machine learning models. This includes Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Services, and Azure Bot Service.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Security and Identity: Azure includes offerings such as Azure Active Directory (AD) for identity and access management, Azure Security Center for threat protection, and Azure Sentinel for cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM).\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Analytics: Azure provides services for working with big data, such as Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse). It also includes services like Azure Stream Analytics for real-time data processing.\n",
       "\n",
       "These are just a few highlights, as Azure offers a broad range of services to meet different business needs. Let me know if there is anything specific you would like to explore further or if you have any specific questions about Azure."
